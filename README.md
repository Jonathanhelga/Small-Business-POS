# Small-Business-POS

I started this project on August 15, 2025.  
I built this project for my parents, who are planning to open an electric shop. They needed a simple but reliable POS (Point of Sale) system to manage inventory, track stock, and handle customer orders.  
Besides helping my parents, I also created this project to improve my web development skills and gain a deeper understanding of JavaScriptâ€™s multi-function capabilities.
