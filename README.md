# Small-Business-POS

**Started:** August 15, 2025

I built this project for my parents, who are planning to open an electric shop. They needed a simple but reliable POS (Point of Sale) system to manage inventory, track stock, and handle customer orders.

Beyond solving a real business need, this project has been an invaluable learning experience for improving my full-stack development skills and gaining a deeper understanding of JavaScript's multi-function capabilities.

> **Note:** I wish I'd uploaded my progress to GitHub earlier, but I fell into the classic trap of waiting for it to be "good enough." Lesson learned—progress over perfection!


## Getting Started

Below you'll find detailed explanations of each file and its purpose. If you'd like to try this project yourself, follow steps 1-4 to set up the basic structure, then simply copy the provided files into your project directory.

POS APP I CREATED STEP BY STEP:
1. create an empty folder
2. initialize Node (npm init -y) it will create package.json
3. install all dependencies I use Node.JS/Express (npm install express mysql2 cors)
    These packages will be listed under "dependencies" in package.json.
    - express → Web framework for building APIs (your Node backend).
    - mysql2 → MySQL client library that lets Node connect and query your MySQL/SQLite DB.
    - cors → Middleware that controls which frontend can call your backend API.
4. npm install --save-dev nodemon (developer tool)
    nodemon automatically restarts the Node server when code is changed.
    - Saves time so I don’t have to stop/start manually.

 ├─ node_modules
 ├─ package.json
 ├─ package-lock.json
 ├─ app.js
 └─ public/     ← frontend files (CSS, JS, assets)
 └─ server/     ← server files (routes, database)

set up the database by using mysql (so you need to have XAMPP) :
- I designed and implemented a POS (Point of Sale) database for my parents’  electric shop. The database is named electric_shop and is structured to support inventory management, billing, and sales tracking
    1. Item_Inventory (Stores detailed information about every product)
        - item_id – unique identifier for each item
        - sku – stock keeping unit (used as the barcode in-store)
        - item_name – product name
        - category – product category (e.g., cables, switches, tools)
        - quantity – current stock level
        - unit – unit of measurement (e.g., pcs, box, pack)
        - cost_price – purchase price from supplier
        - selling_price – retail price
        - minimum_stock_level – threshold for reordering
        - supplier_info – supplier details
        - date_added – when the item was first created
        - date_updated – last update timestamp
        - created_by – who added the item
        - is_active – whether the item is currently active or discontinued
    (Since this POS is only for in-store use, there’s no need for official UPC codes. Instead, the SKU is used as the barcode to identify and scan products.)

    2. Bills (Tracks all customer transactions.)
        - bill_id – unique identifier for each bill
        - order_datetime – date and time of purchase
        - total_amount – total amount of the order
        - customer_name – customer’s name (optional)
        - payment_method – e.g., cash, card, transfer
        - status – active (valid) or inactive (e.g., canceled, returned)

    3. Bill_Item (Links each bill with its purchased items.)
        - bill_item_id – unique identifier for each line item
        - bill_id – references the corresponding bill
        - sku – references the product in Item_Inventory
        - item_name – product name 
        - ordered_quantity – how many units were purchased
        - unit_price – selling price per unit at time of purchase
        - subtotal – ordered_quantity × unit_price
